## Create Assistant to analyze S&P 500 Index


### Goal
Create an assistant to analyze the S&P 500 index data, and immediately ask your teammate to try. All this is done in 5 minutes. You can replace the S&P 500 index data with any other structured data you have.


### Background
The Standard and Poor's 500 or S&P 500 is the most famous financial benchmark in the world.

This stock market index tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of this index.

Now we can build a tool to analyze the S&P 500 index.

### Let's get started

What you will have:
* here's the dataset we use [SP500](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18m6OanLxQuPJBcI79bTeghTRF2YxHyeysiax-SzIJMg/edit?usp=sharing), which contains the S&P 500 index data.

### Step 1: Create A Table in ReByte

* Choose a tableset, create a table named "sp500" in ReByte.
* Clone the above dataset to your Google Drive, publish it to the web as either a CSV or Excel file, get the export link, and then import it into ReByte. Be sure to select the source type if you export as CSV, choose CSV, if you export as Excel, choose Excel.
    * For lazy person, use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRspzExmRd4eUD9pXEDohGWVKmMqs6IYeBYIVkJ4vfTWryXaZJFWVWH9cJwMNEtf4cRFRGFBuRI7zi9/pub?output=csv) for csv, this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRspzExmRd4eUD9pXEDohGWVKmMqs6IYeBYIVkJ4vfTWryXaZJFWVWH9cJwMNEtf4cRFRGFBuRI7zi9/pub?output=xlsx) for Excel.
* Update the table schema by using the above dataset.


### Step 2: Create 
* Go to assistant settings -> add tool -> choose "Data Analysis" template, choose the table "sp500" you created in step 1 for both "load table" and "query table" actions.

Then you're good to go.
