## Create a Fraud Analysis Assistant

Background: The Standard and Poor's 500 or S&P 500 is the most famous financial benchmark in the world.

This stock market index tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of this index.

Now we can build a tool to analyze the S&P 500 index.



What you will have:
* here's the dataset we use [SP500](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18m6OanLxQuPJBcI79bTeghTRF2YxHyeysiax-SzIJMg/edit?usp=sharing), which contains the S&P 500 index data.

### Step 1: Create A Table in ReByte

* Choose a tableset, create a table named "sp500" in ReByte.
* Clone the above dataset to your Google Drive, publish it to the web as either a CSV or Excel file, get the export link, and then import it into ReByte. Be sure to select the source type if you export as CSV, choose CSV, if you export as Excel, choose Excel.
    * For lazy person, use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRspzExmRd4eUD9pXEDohGWVKmMqs6IYeBYIVkJ4vfTWryXaZJFWVWH9cJwMNEtf4cRFRGFBuRI7zi9/pub?output=csv) for csv, this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRspzExmRd4eUD9pXEDohGWVKmMqs6IYeBYIVkJ4vfTWryXaZJFWVWH9cJwMNEtf4cRFRGFBuRI7zi9/pub?output=xlsx) for Excel.
* Update the table schema to reflect the data in the dataset. You can explore the data by clicking the "Explore," and use any SQL query to filter the data.

### Step 2: Create 
Create a new tool in ReByte, and name it "Fraud Analysis."
ReByte has prebuilt template for data analysis,
you can choose the "Data Analysis" template, and then you can modify it to fit your need.
**Remember** to change the table to the "transaction" table you created in step 1 in both the "load table" and "query table" actions.


**IMPORTANT**:
You should change the tool to point to load schema from the "transaction" table, also run SQL on the same table.
You probably want to change input dataset to reflect what you want to analyze.


### Step 3: Add 'Fraud Analysis' Tool to Your Assistant
Now you can add the "Fraud Analysis" tool to your team's assistant. 

Another way you can do is create a new assistant, specifically for fraud analysis, and add the "Fraud Analysis" tool to this assistant.


Party time! You have successfully built a fraud analysis assistant.

Now it's ready to use by your team members. 

Try querying the assistant with questions like:

* **Show me the top 10 transactions with the highest amount**

* **How many transactions are there in total? How many are fraudulent?**
