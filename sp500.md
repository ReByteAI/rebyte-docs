### Goal
Create an assistant to analyze the S&P 500 index data, and immediately give your teammate a try. All this is done in 5 minutes. You can replace the S&P 500 index data with any other structured data you have.


### Background
The Standard and Poor's 500 or S&P 500 is the most famous financial benchmark in the world.

This stock market index tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of this index.

Now we can build a tool to analyze the S&P 500 index.

### Let's get started

What you will have:
* here's the dataset we use [SP500](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18m6OanLxQuPJBcI79bTeghTRF2YxHyeysiax-SzIJMg/edit?usp=sharing), which contains the S&P 500 index data.

### Step 1: Create A Table in ReByte

* Choose a tableset, create a table named "sp500" in ReByte.
    * if you don't have a tableset, create a new tableset. Tableset is used to group multiple tables together, and set access control for all tables in the tableset.
* Clone the above dataset to your Google Drive, publish it to the web as either a CSV or Excel file, get the export link, and then import it into ReByte. Be sure to select the source type if you export as CSV, choose CSV, if you export as Excel, choose Excel.
    * If you're lazy, use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRspzExmRd4eUD9pXEDohGWVKmMqs6IYeBYIVkJ4vfTWryXaZJFWVWH9cJwMNEtf4cRFRGFBuRI7zi9/pub?output=csv) for csv, this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRspzExmRd4eUD9pXEDohGWVKmMqs6IYeBYIVkJ4vfTWryXaZJFWVWH9cJwMNEtf4cRFRGFBuRI7zi9/pub?output=xlsx) for Excel.
* Make sure:
  * csv is your table source type
  * link is the above link for csv
  * use 'SELECT * FROM src' as query to build the table
* Update the table schema by using the above dataset.
* Explore the table using standard SQL queries to make sure the content is correct.


### Step 2: Create An Assistant
* Create a new assistant
* Go to assistant settings -> add tool -> choose "Data Analysis" template, choose the table "sp500" you created in step 1 for both "load table" and "query table" actions.
* Save the assistant

Then you're good to go.

Here are some examples you can try:

```code
what's google's market cap?
```

```code
Of all companies in sp500 that have at least 100b market cap, who has the highest PE? 
```

or any other complex queries you can think of.

### Two nice things you will notice
* A nice thing you will notice is not only you get results, but you also get the original data from your dataset, so you can verify if the result is correct.
* Rebyte can update table automatically, it looks like you have a read-only database that can be shared with your desired team members.
