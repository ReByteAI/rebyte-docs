# Early Return

This action allows you to return the result early without running the rest of the actions in the agent.It's very useful when you want to return the result early without running the rest of the actions.

## Usage

* You don't need to set anything for this action. Just add it to where you want to return early.

* This is usually used in the `If Else` action. For example, you can add an `Early Return` action in the `If` block, and the system will return the result early if the condition is true. Otherwise, the system will skip the actions in the `If` block and continue to run the actions.
