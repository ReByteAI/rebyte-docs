# Dataset Loader

The `Dataset Loader` action allows you to load data from the agent's datasets. The data can be used in subsequent actions.

## Usage

* Add a `Dataset Loader` action to your agent and select the dataset you want to load from.


* Refer to this data by using the dataset's name, like: `{{DATA_2}}` in downstream actions.
